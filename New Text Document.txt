1.) In session of DBMS the  Normalization is the technique to organize the data in a systematic approach.

2.) the Normalization technique are useful to make to reduce the redundancy of the data in tables.

3.) This is use to reduce the undwsired anamolie like insert, delete and update.

4.) the insert, delete anamolie like null values and other factors are eliminated.

5.) perpose of the Normalization is to : (a) Reduce the data redundancy
					 (b) the data is used to stored according to the type and at its logical storage.


6.) there are 4 normalization rule:
	(a) 1st Normal Form : First normal form (1NF) is a property of a relation in a relational database. A relation is in first normal form if and only if the domain of each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.
	(b) 2nd Normal form : The second NF should be first NF then every non key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key. The attributes IDSt and IDProf are the identification keys.
	(c) 3rd Normal form :  the entity is in second normal form and no non-prime (non-key) attribute is transitively dependent on any key i.e. no non-prime attribute depends on other non-prime attributes. All the non-prime attributes must depend only on the keys.
	(d) BCNF : A table is in BCNF if every functional dependency X ? Y, X is the super key of the table. For BCNF, the table should be in 3NF, and for every FD, LHS is super key.
